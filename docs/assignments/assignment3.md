# Assignment 3

Collaborator - ChatGPT (proofreading only)

The transition from high school to college can be overwhelming. Students learn to live on their own for the first time and have to make their own decisions in their academic, social, and professional lives. Mainstream social media paints a glamorous picture of friends and trips and outings, and many students feel isolated by the lack of genuine connection and support. StudyCalm is a mental health-focused community that provides users with accountability, guidance and positivity. Users can connect with others in their school and in their specific classes, sharing advice and encouragement. There is a social aspect, including affinity groups that encourage offline meetups, and a personal aspect that includes goal setting tools for productivity and wellbeing. This can be a supportive space for students who might not have access to traditional therapy for financial or other reasons.

By blending mindfulness with peer connection, StudyCalm helps students become their best selves -- emotionally resilient, focused, and connected -- throughout their college journey.
