# Assignment 1

My hunch/theme is to build social media suitable for the neurodivergent community, which includes the autism spectrum and ADHD. They are definitely underserved by current social media which vastly favors neurotypicals.
For my needfinding, I interviewed two people – one, my Venezuelan-American close friend who studies computer science at Northeastern but has been diagnosed with autism at age five. He is currently off Instagram, and I look forward to exploring with him his views on social media and how it could be better. He is very candid so this will definitely be a productive conversation. The second person would be someone non-college affiliated with ADHD and how social media impacts them as well.

To spur the conversation, I will just ask them about their condition, how it has made their life better or worse, and also ask them about how social media has made their life better or worse. I probably won’t directly ask them design questions, but I’ll hopefully take inspiration from their responses.

# Interviewee I Raw Notes

Facebook now, YouTube for viewing
Instagram quit, never used Tiktok, Reddit, Twitter
Yes Linkedin professionally
He actually got confused for a second and didn’t know why he quit Instagram
“Found it pretty distracting”
Still use facebook for communication, and not the only way around because he was using Instagram with his phone, binge watching reels, but Facebook you can set a time limit
Neurodivergence neutral effect
Christian identity
Just said that Facebook might listen to us talking about neurodivergence!
He doesn’t make neurodivergence part of his identity, so he doesn’t feel so strongly about it
He knows others who own it but he detaches himself from that
“Garbage on a screen” as he eats his PB&J
And when I push him on sensory issues, he admits others on the spectrum
Social media - “good if you’re an adult, sucks if you’re a kid”
Regrets being an “iPad baby” which has made him lose the socialization and interpersonal skills he needed at times
If Instagram could change one thing to make you use it again – “disable the reels”
But yeah, he doesn’t have many other thoughts than that
Twitter like number, Instagram liked by others

# Interviewee II Raw Notes

Uses Reddit now and TikTok a lot during COVID but recently quit TikTok, feels happier
Love-hate relationship with social media, he uses it to connect with people, but he also procrastinates way too much on it.
Says he will “scroll all day and get nothing else done”
Can’t really do his hobbies as they produce less dopamine in comparison
Says his hobbies include video games, reading, and language learning
Language learning?
Spanish, Duolingo, telenovelas
I speak Spanish, his Spanish is OK but can be better
On Duolingo, I comment on how colorful and bright and celebratory it is, stimulating dopamine just like social media
He says that he doesn’t follow a consistent routine and often just does one lesson to keep the streak alive.
Same with me for Leetcode (heh)
Hops between books
Many unfinished, right now reading Atomic Habits
So he is trying to self improve!
As for the ADHD himself, he got diagnosed in high school
He had a hunch since he always got distracted in things and submit his assignments on the last day, and he would deliver a good presentation after cramming that day
Temporary hyperfocus
He’s always 5 minutes late to anything no matter how early he plans
His mind loves racing, when he was in Seattle for the summer, and had to take a bus to his internship office, he would always run and catch it literally last minute.
Parents would call him lazy, and even after the diagnosis, they still think he’s lazy and that the doctors are enabling laziness.
Recently he’s been trying to sleep at 9-10 but always stays up till 1 anyway until he snaps out of his social media hyperfocus and finally dozes off
So social media is eating into his bedtime, but it’s more the ADHD than the social media
He would like a focus mode that blocks out things, like non language learning things on Reddit when he is trying to learn the language
Or gentle time limits

# Summaries

So the first interview, I talked to my friend from another school who is on the spectrum (he was diagnosed at age five) but definitely high functioning. He is accomplished in computer science, interning with Amazon with me two summers ago and interning for Slack in San Francisco last summer. As for social media, he used to have an Instagram, but he deleted it because he found it “pretty distracting.” But it wasn’t an urgent thing, the deletion, it was more based on a whim, as he struggled to remember at first why he deleted that app in the first place. He only uses Facebook now, and he doesn’t really check posts or interacts with posts or likes them or anything, he just uses it to communicate with other people on Facebook, so kind of the bare minimum. He says that Facebook also lets him set a time limit, whereas on Instagram he would spend hours watching reels. I ask him if his neurodivergence has affected the way he uses social media, he says that not really because he is high functioning and doesn’t make his diagnosis a big part of his identity, in fact what is a big part is being Christian, as he got a lot closer to the church during college, so he belongs much more to the Christian community than the neurodivergent community. Instead, he quips saying that now he will get Facebook ads on autism and ADHD now that the app is hearing us talk about it. He doesn’t care too much about making social media better or worse as he sees it as a lowbrow pursuit in general – “garbage on a screen,” as he munches on a PB&J sandwich. When I ask him what would make him come back to Instagram, he says “disable the reels.” All in all, social media to him is “good if you’re an adult, sucks if you’re a kid,” as he then goes on a drawn out lamentation on how he was born and raised as an “iPad baby” and how that limited his socialization, made him develop an ego that pushed people away, when he self reflects on his life, he gets very candid, but he pivoted away from social media here so that’s that. I ask him about some other details like Instagram’s chronological order or the like numbers being hidden but I get no insights there. It was a decent conversation overall though I would have liked to see more impact caused by his diagnosis.

The second interview is someone with ADHD who I am not close to, I just recruited them for this interview. He uses Reddit and used to use TikTok, but just like my friend who quit Instagram, he quit TikTok for similar reasons, and he realizes that leaving that makes a lot more free time. Beforehand, he would “scroll all day and get nothing else done.” I tell him I’ve had days like that in the past as well, where I would just feel very grumpy after just spending a whole day vibing on the screen. But I let him elaborate. He likes gaming, reading, and language learning, he’s been trying to teach himself Spanish. I trade a conversation with him, as I speak Spanish, and he’s decent though could definitely improve. He uses Duolingo and watches telenovelas to get used to hearing the language, so I remark on how Duolingo is colorful and bright and celebratory, stimulating dopamine just like social media. He says that some days he’s lazy and just does “one lesson to keep the streak alive”. He didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until high school, but he could tell something was up because he was always a leave it until the last minute kind of guy. No matter how early he left or thought about leaving, he would always be 5 minutes late to everything. This affects his sleep schedule as well, as he wants to sleep earlier but often keeps scrolling until 1 or 2 am, he sleeps in the next day and tells himself he’s going to sleep earlier tonight, and the cycle continues. This is relevant to the social media part as most of that scrolling involves Reddit, and formerly TikTok as well. I ask him if he’s used the screen time blockers before, and he says he has, but the addiction to scrolling has just made him lose interest in his other hobbies, and time without the screen passes really slowly. So he has no choice but to unblock himself and go back to the screens. So the social media exacerbates the ADHD. He thinks maybe some sort of focus mode or features that make social media less stimulating could help, less stimulatory but still not a cold turkey stop.

# Design opportunities:

Balancing dopamine hits and deeper engagement. Both interviewers say their condition lets them waste too much time on social media, but they don’t want to lose the engagement completely - the first interviewer still uses Facebook for communication, so there just has to be some sort of middle ground.

Very unorthodox but since some neurodivergent people’s interests change rapidly, maybe give you the chance to delete all your following from scratch and start anew based on your new interest or phase. The second interviewer also mentioned intense phases/hyperfixations as part of his ADHD condition. So in general, accounting for shifting interests and the different ways that neurodivergent brains work.

Built in custom time checks/controls and blockers. This is the most obvious of the three, but have something more granular and custom to the user that reduces incentives to un jailbreak themselves. Both interviewees would like this honestly.
