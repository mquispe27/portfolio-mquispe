# A UI Look at Windows Vista

When in lecture for UI Visual Design, one example that stood out to me was that of Windows 8, and how it introduced a completely different start menu that threw everyone off, which made Microsoft revert back to a more classic start menu for Windows 10. In fact, Windows seems to alternate between very well and very poorly received operating systems. XP, 7, and 10 are iconic but Vista and 8 fall by the wayside.

My family bought their first PC in 2009, so I grew up with Windows Vista, and I have fond memories of using that OS for my whole childhood, and today I'll take a look at the UI visual design of this operating system and figure out why it never caught on.

First of all, the most obvious detail is that Vista came out at a time in the mid to late 2000s where the futuristic glossy Web 2.0 aesthetic was at its peak. This look, chock full of gradients and shine, was not only in Windows but also in the earliest iPhones and basically all websites at the time.

Windows called this look Aero Glass. The start menu had gradients. All the media player buttons and built in apps had gradients. The window borders were semitransparent. A gradient was even stuffed into the Control Panel, or at the navbar in the file explorer. All of this was impressive. It took you straight to the year 3000.

Needless to say, even the bars had gradients, here showing the capacity of the hard drive, the dropdown menus too, the back button. In fact, the term for the shiny buttons looking three dimensional is skeuomorphic design. They want it to resemble the real thing.

So I have to say this color scheme was groundbreaking and a powerful contrast to the much simpler XP that came before. The desktop is nostalgic for many, with the overly saturated landscape that is now associated with the early 2000s aesthetic in general. XP was certainly more colorful than its predecessor, Windows 98, which had a far flatter, muted, old school vibe straight from the 80s/90s, like the computer is all work and no play.

While Windows 98 is the last of the old school operating systems, XP had the Luna theme, with its bright colors that make the computer a lot more friendly and approachable than whatever Windows 98 was. This says a lot about how color can define an app's mood and accessibility, building on what we discussed in class about color. Vista took this in a whole new direction with its ultra sleek, ultra glossy interface, but after spending this blog hyping it up, the ultimate reason Vista did not succeed is not the interface -- the far more successful Windows 7 continued with the Aero look, but a bit toned down -- but technical issues.

The Aero look demanded a lot from the hardware. Graphics, memory, performance. A lot of little animations that were not necessary beforehand, like hovering over a close button and changing the gradient to another gradient. This was compounded on old machines upgrading to Vista, to the point that many users had to revert to the XP/98 look and feel just to use it properly. Windows 7 addressed these issues well, but Windows 8 and iOS 7 were a massive shift colorwise. It brought us to the 2010s of UI design, with simple flat colors, that are much easier for touchscreens. This has happened on PC, Mac, mobile devices, and websites since around 2013-14. Much of this class would not be possible without the evolution of the aesthetic of software design from 98 to Vista to now. In looking futuristic, Vista now looks dated, such is the history of these things.
