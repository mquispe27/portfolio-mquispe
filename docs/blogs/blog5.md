# A Cognitive Walkthrough of Attacking in FIFA

So far, I've seen cognitive walkthroughs of websites and machines, and lecture has shown that it can be used to test user experience across many fields. So I'll use it for a video game, the popular FIFA series, an easy accessible game for millions of sports fans, and one of my favorite games since my childhood, but like all games, hard to master.

As remembered, from lecture, the questions to ask for each task are:

How easily can a user...

1. know they need to do something?
2. notice the correct action is available, and
   associate it with what they're trying to do?
3. based on what occurs after the action is taken,
   know that it was the right thing to have done?
4. understand how they've made progress towards
   their larger goal?

And you answer these four questions for every action inside a task.

So our big overarching task for this blog can be scoring a goal in a game. Naturally, if you're playing FIFA, you have some beginning familiarity with soccer, that you have to kick the ball between players to get it to the back of the net.

And the actions that make up that task involve passing it between outfield players without losing the ball, and then also dribbling the ball, until you have a relatively unobstructed shooting position.

At that point, you shoot and hopefully score. The keeper might save it, the keeper might not. This is the offense. There are more tricks up your sleeve, like lobs, through balls, and crosses, and sprints, but today we will just focus on dribbling, passing, and shooting.

Here are the controls for those actions on Xbox, the console I always played growing up, which involve the joystick for dribbling, the A button for passing, and the B button for shooting.

For dribbling, passing, and shooting, the answer to question 1 is Yes as long as you know soccer and know that's what the essence of the game is. If you aren't familiar with soccer, just watch a few highlights and you'll know you have to dribble, pass, and shoot.

For question 2, dribbling is the easiest to associate with what the player is trying to do, as moving the joystick to move the player (and the ball in the process) is the most intuitive, as you just move in the direction you want the player to go. And you notice the correct actions by studying the controls.

What might not be obvious to the user/tester from studying the controls however, is the complete picture about passing and shooting. You might think, oh, I just press A to pass, and then the pass goes to somewhere you don't want to go. What is implied is that you have to also move the joystick in the direction you want to pass or shoot, despite it not being obvious. This lets you play the game properly.

For question 3, as soon as you move the joystick, you see the player move visually, so it is easy to see for the player that you are doing the right thing. Same for passing and shooting, you can see the actions happen on your screen. And there is also a nuance in pressing A or B too strongly or too lightly that is not captured in the controls either, and you will easily see the results from overhitting your shot on the screen as well. Trial and error. Every new FIFA player skies a one on one at least once.

For question 4, the player/tester can understand their progress by seeing where their players are, and if they are successful at scoring goals, and with all the movements and decisions they have to make to break down the opponents' defense and score.

So that is the essence of the cognitive walkthrough for attacking in FIFA. Overall, easy for the user to grasp, especially if they are familiar with soccer, but with a few initially nontrivial nuances in the controls that are also easily picked up.
