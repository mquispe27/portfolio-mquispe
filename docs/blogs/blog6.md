# Replying to Reflections on Building a Company That Cares

[Link to original blog](https://dismint.github.io/portfolio-jchoi/blogs/blog1.html)

Hello, this is a reply to a blog by Justin on moving fast vs moving with intent for my last blog of the semester. I enjoyed Lyel's lecture on design that matters and liked all the thoughts and considerations on building a product that solves authentic problems from start to finish. I learned that while good intentions are important, they are not sufficient.

Justin, I did appreciate your idea on direction review checks and find them a solid way to reconcile the yin and yang of moving fast and moving with intent. It works on a granular scale, helping teams maintain focus and make necessary adjustments without sacrificing the benefits of agile development. Finding that equilibrium can really make the world a better place. There is a difference between having a mega large corporation and a small niche startup with a core team that handles everything. The small startup can better align themselves with both speed and intent, but once scale comes into the picture, it gets difficult. I interned at Google last summer, and as an intern, I was somewhere around 7 or 8 levels away from the CEO in the chain of command. Even then, it's considered a relatively flat structure.

So it's important for the company to have an overarching theme, but what could work is that teams in areas where it's important to "move fast and break things" can prioritize speed, while other teams prioritize intent. In my case, for example, my team promoted steady progress and intent rather than moving fast, as weekly syncs revealed gradual progress toward upkeep, new features, launches and patches. Therefore Google the corporation would have the best of both worlds, while both angles contribute to their greater vision. Not endorsing search though, there is a lot of discourse around the downfall of search, but perhaps with my nuanced team strategy or with your direction review checks strategy, we can see a company that cares for their user base and the world as a whole.
