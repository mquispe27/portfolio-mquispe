# The Nine Dot Puzzle

When we discussed the candle puzzle in lecture, and how it involves thinking outside the box and overcoming our cognitive biases, the very first thing that came to my mind was the nine dots puzzle, and I just knew I had to write a blog post.

The puzzle asks you to take these nine dots and connect them all with four strokes of a pen without lifting it at all.

This puzzle gets posted endlessly on social media, each time finding a new group of people not yet familiar with the trick. Like one thinking that the thumbtacks must be used in the candle puzzle, a person's cognitive bias often forces them to only think about connecting the dots, that is, a stroke of the pen must begin at one point, and end at another. It makes sense. Connecting the dots hearkens back to your early childhood when you would finish pages and pages of these things. But here, it doesn't work. Drawing a spiral to connect the dots, as shown below, is five strokes, not four.

Zigzagging through the dots? Five strokes.

Another type of zigzagging? Five strokes. It fails every time.

At this point, the prospective solver is stumped. Until a hint indicates, think outside the box! Literally.

This is where the phrase comes from. The lines need not end at the points themselves -- they can extend beyond the grid, i.e. "outside the box", and the solution becomes very clear.

Four strokes! It's possible, and pretty simple as long as the person unblocks themselves of the preconceived intuitive notion, that the lines can only end at the dots. It is the embodiment of a fixation that limits you and doesn't let you solve the puzzle unless you don't let it do so.

This puzzle dates back to the late 19th century. In a French chess journal in 1867, puzzle author and top chess player Sam Loyd developed a precursor to the puzzle, with an 8x8 grid rather than a 3x3. The first version of today's puzzle appeared as the Columbus Egg Puzzle in the Strand Magazine in 1907, published by the same Sam Loyd.

Since the original solution, more people have broken the rules in more arbitrary ways, breaking even more cognitive biases, such as considering the nature of the dots and the lines. Are the dots infinitesimally small points, or do they have finite size? If they have finite size, three asymptotically (i.e. 10^-infinity slope) horizontal lines can connect even the tiniest nine dots possible. A simplified example is shown here, though with larger dots.

Similarly, who said anything about the size of the line? The original problem says four strokes of a pen, but if we generalize the problem to any four lines, you will need only one extremely thick line to connect all nine points!

Lastly, you could even roll the paper up and connect all nine dots with one line like this:

I'd like to hear if anyone has more solutions to this puzzle that they could of, or if anyone could share more puzzles that reinforce and reveal new things about the fixations we discussed in class today.
